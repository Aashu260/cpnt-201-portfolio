## Future Web developer

### I am currently a SAIT student learning about Web development. I am learning about the designing aspect of development and also the programming part of it too.

### I want to pursue Web development as my career.

### _I am very keen on meeting new developers, to learn more about the development environment. It will also allow me to improve my skills and to acquire the new ones._
